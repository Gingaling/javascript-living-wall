# javascript-living-wall


This is a drag-and-drop project in which I eventually hope to have a library of plant images which one can drag-and-drop onto a grid so as to create living wall mock-ups before creating the real thing. I followed Tom Devin's 4-part drag-and-drop tutorial (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zem8j3AWxdI), which is great. His version, however, had all images reordered after moving an image.

You will notice then an index2.html. This version only swaps two images (a selected image with the image whose space you want to move it into (hovering over)).

Additional functionality will eventually include:

being able to add images to the library
adding images wherever you choose (versus a strict grid pattern) {this will be helpful if, for instance, you want to add sphagnum moss accents to a mini-living project)
Feel free to let me know if you can think of additional features that would be cool to include.
